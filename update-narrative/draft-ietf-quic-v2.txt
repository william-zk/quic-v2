                       draft-ietf-quic-v2-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC
   version 1 except for some trivial details.  Its purpose is to combat
   various ossification vectors and exercise the version negotiation
   framework.  It also serves as a template for the minimum changes in
   any future version of QUIC.

   Note that "version 2" is an informal name for this proposal that
   indicates it is the second standards-track QUIC version.  The
   protocol specified here will receive a version number other than 2
   from IANA.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF
   mailing list quic@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains
   the draft: https://github.com/quicwg/quic-v2.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC [RFC9000] has numerous extension points, including the version
   number that occupies the second through fifth octets of every long
   header (see [RFC8999]).  If experimental versions are rare, and QUIC
   version 1 constitutes the vast majority of QUIC traffic, there is the
   potential for middleboxes to ossify on the version octets always
   being 0x00000001.

   Furthermore, version 1 Initial packets are encrypted with keys
   derived from a universally known salt, which allow observers to
   inspect the contents of these packets, which include the TLS Client
   Hello and Server Hello messages.  Again, middleboxes may ossify on
   the version 1 key derivation and packet formats.

   Finally [QUIC-VN] provides two mechanisms for endpoints to negotiate
   the QUIC version to use.  The "incompatible" version negotiation
   method can support switching from any initial QUIC version to any
   other version with full generality, at the cost of an additional
   round-trip at the start of the connection.  "Compatible" version
   negotiation eliminates the round-trip penalty but levies some
   restrictions on how much the two versions can differ semantically.

   QUIC version 2 is meant to mitigate ossification concerns and
   exercise the version negotiation mechanisms.  The only change is a
   tweak to the inputs of some crypto derivation functions to enforce
   full key separation.  Any endpoint that supports two versions needs
   to implement version negotiation to protect against downgrade
   attacks.

   [I-D.duke-quic-version-aliasing] is a more robust, but much more
   complicated, proposal to address these ossification problems.  By
   design, it requires incompatible version negotiation.  QUICv2 enables
   exercise of compatible version negotiation mechanism.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Changes from QUIC Version 1

   QUIC version 2 endpoints MUST implement the QUIC version 1
   specification as described in [RFC9000], [RFC9001], and [RFC9002],
   with the following changes:

   *  The version field of long headers is TBD.  Note: Unless this
      document is published as an RFC, implementations should use the
      provisional value 0xff020000, which might change with each edition
      of this document.

   *  The salt used to derive Initial keys in Sec 5.2 of [RFC9001]
      changes to

   initial_salt = 0xa707c203a59b47184a1d62ca570406ea7ae3e5d3

   *  The labels used in [RFC9001] to derive packet protection keys (Sec
      5.1), header protection keys (Sec 5.4), Retry Integrity Tag keys
      (Sec 5.8), and key updates (Sec 6.1) change from "quic key" to
      "quicv2 key", from "quic iv" to "quicv2 iv", from "quic hp" to
      "quicv2 hp", and from "quic ku" to "quicv2 ku", to meet the
      guidance for new versions in Section 9.6 of that document.

   *  The key and nonce used for the Retry Integrity Tag (Sec 5.8 of
      [RFC9001]) change to:

secret = 0x3425c20cf88779df2ff71e8abfa78249891e763bbed2f13c048343d348c060e2
key = 0xba858dc7b43de5dbf87617ff4ab253db
nonce = 0x141b99c239b03e785d6a2e9f

4.  Version Negotiation Considerations

   QUIC version 2 endpoints SHOULD also support QUIC version 1.  Any
   QUIC endpoint that supports multiple versions MUST fully implement
   [QUIC-VN] to prevent version downgrade attacks.

   Note that version 2 meets that document's definition of a compatible
   version with version 1.  Therefore, v2-capable servers MUST use
   compatible version negotiation unless they do not support version 1.

4.1.  Compatible Negotiation Requirements

   Compatible version negotiation between versions 1 and 2 follow the
   same requirements in either direction.  This section uses the terms
   "original version" and "negotiated version" from [QUIC-VN].

   If the server elects to send a Retry packet, it MUST do so using the
   original version.

   The server SHOULD start sending its Initial packets using the
   negotiated version as soon as it decides to change.  Note that the
   server might send some Initial packets using the original version.

   Once the client has processed a packet using the negotiated version,
   it SHOULD send subsequent Initial packets using that version.  The
   server MUST NOT discard its original version Initial receive keys
   until it successfully processes a packet with the negotiated version.

   Both endpoints MUST send Handshake or 1-RTT packets using the
   negotiated version.  An endpoint MUST drop packets using any other
   version.  Endpoints have no need to generate the keying material that
   would allow them to decrypt or authenticate these packets.

   If the server's version_information transport parameter does not
   contain a Chosen Version field equivalent to the version in the
   server's Handshake packet headers, the client MUST terminate the
   connection with a VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR.

   The client MUST NOT send 0-RTT packets using the negotiated version,
   even after processing a packet of that version from the server.
   Servers can apply original version 0-RTT packets to a connection
   without additional considerations.

5.  Ossification Considerations

   QUIC version 2 provides protection against some forms of
   ossification.  Devices that assume that all long headers will contain
   encode version 1, or that the version 1 Initial key derivation
   formula will remain version-invariant, will not correctly process
   version 2 packets.

   However, many middleboxes such as firewalls focus on the first packet
   in a connection, which will often remain in the version 1 format due
   to the considerations above.

   Clients interested in combating firewall ossification can initiate a
   connection using version 2 if they are either reasonably certain the
   server supports it, or are willing to suffer a round-trip penalty if
   they are incorrect.

6.  Applicability

   This version of QUIC provides no change from QUIC version 1 relating
   to the capabilities available to applications.  Therefore, all
   Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ([RFC7301]) codepoints
   specified to operate over QUICv1 can also operate over this version
   of QUIC.

   All QUIC extensions defined to work with version 1 also work with
   version 2.

7.  Security Considerations

   QUIC version 2 introduces no changes to the security or privacy
   properties of QUIC version 1.

   The mandatory version negotiation mechanism guards against downgrade
   attacks, but downgrades have no security implications, as the version
   properties are identical.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA add the following entry to the QUIC
   version registry:

   Value: TBD

   Status: permanent

   Specification: This Document

   Change Controller: IETF

   Contact: QUIC WG
